> ðŸš§ Work In Progress

The **post archiver** part of the Modal application makes it easy to continuously backup your online posts to a database.
With this backup you can do fun things:

- Full-text search, and text analytics
- Train a chat-bot
- Train a question-answering bot

The application currently supports collecting posts from the following sources:

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
- [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
- RSS (which I used to collect personal blog posts from [thundergolfer.com/blog](https://thundergolfer.com/blog))

## How-to setup

1. Create a [Modal.com](https://modal.com) account, if you don't already have one.
2. Fill in the required config values in `config.py`
3. Create `modal.Secret`s for OpenAI API Key and Weaviate cluster URL.
4. Create a `virtualenv` and install locally-required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Provide chatbot bootstrapping in `ama_data.py`, or optionally write code to download some and format it.
