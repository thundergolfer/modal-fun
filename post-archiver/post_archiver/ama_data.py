    """What's your favorite food?

A few of my favorite foods would be simple pasta with Napolitana sauce and fresh basil,
Paneer Lababdar curry with naan, or hot chips (AKA thick-cut fries).

Before I went vegatarian, my favorite foods were probably spagetti and meatballs and steak,
but I don't miss them that much. My favorite flavor is lime.

    """Do you have any regrets?
I feel like I wasted a lot of time in my teens and twenties playing video games.
Video games are great, but I did not play in moderation. There were probably periods where I played
over thirty hours a week, despite having school and a part-time job. This was not time well spent.
I could have accomplished a lot more in my twenties if I was more focused on building things and learning.

I also generally regret doing architecture as my first undergraduate degree. In hindsight, I should have
taken more seriously the fact that most architecture students don't become architects, and the field is
generally full of underpaid and overworked people.

If I had my twenties again, I would have gone straight into computer science or physics, and spent a lot more
time studying maths and programming. Programming is pretty fun anyway, a good replacement for Call of Duty.

What are you proudest about in your life?

I don't really like answering this question. I tend to focus more on what I'm not doing well rather than what
I'm good at and should be proud of. But anyway, I'll give an answer:

- I'm proud of stopping eating meat and going vegetarian. I did not know any vegetarians, so I started pretty much on my own.
- I'm proud of making a successful switch into software. I did some basic analysis when I was 23 and figured it was the best field to go into and I thought I could succeed there. I was right, I think.
- I've donated over $100,000 to Effective Altruism causes, mostly bed nets.

What does your future hold?

Eventually kids, starting a company, and growing old with my partner.

What's your job?

I'm a software engineer at Modal Labs in New York City. I've been a full-time software engineer since the
middle of 2018. I've generally worked in data teams, alongside data scientists and data engineers.

While at university (i.e. college) I worked for over five years as a waiter at a place called The Brighton International.
I also did waitering and catering work at a bunch of other venues, the highlights probably being The Birdcage at the Melbourne Cup
and the 2014 AFL Brownlow Medal ceremony. Well, the Brownlow Medal ceremony was a frustrating night of waitering as you could only work
during ad breaks, but it was still cool to see the event up close.

What are your parents like?

I don't know what my father was like. He died when I was eight and I think to cope I pushed away all memories
of him. My mother is now an inspiration to me, though she was a strict parent. I won't say more for now.
""",
    """
Did you enjoy school?

I generally enjoyed school because I was academically successful and had good friendships with my classmates.
I probably peaked in primary school, where I was school captain (head boy). As I hit my later teens I got too
arrogant and cynical about school and thought that I'd have to wait for tertiary education to find great teachers, engaged
peers, and stimulating classes.

Overall I'd say adult life is much better than school life. I don't look back on my school years and wish I could do it again.
Being 30, as I am now, is better; being 24 was also good.
""",
    """
What do you do for fun?

I used to play video games a lot, and watch Australian Rules Football (AFL). I don't do those things anymore
and have replaced them with programming and also reading â€” somehow I got even nerdier.

Programming is really fun though. I never expected it to be so fun, I just hoped it would be interesting enough to make a remunerative
career out of. I'm now one of those people that would retire and program for free, and I already do programming side projects
on weekends for fun.
""",
    """
Do you like your job?

Yes, best job I've ever had, and feel very priviledged to work with my team and on the product we're building.
I often think of the worst low-wage service industry jobs I worked, incredibly dull and often degrading, and think
it's just absurd how good my post-college jobs have been.

What I want most out of a job is not money, it's much more about learning from teammates and mentors, and growing technically
towards acheived whatever I'd call mastery of software engineering. I'm romantic about software, in part because of The Soul of a New Machine.

    """
What are your favorite books, and the books you really don't like?

My favorite book is The Great Gatsby, because I think it's sentence-level writing is incredible and I like the tradegy of
the Gatsby character, a dirt-poor boy who through the classic American self-developmental spirit rose to great wealth and virtue,
but ultimately failed to elevate his class and recapture his past.

My favorite author is Kurt Vonnegut. I've read maybe eight of his books, more than any author author.

I tend not to hold onto the books that I don't like, though I remember how awful Barry Goldwater's
The Conscience of a Conservative was, and I thought The Martian was really poorly written.

    """
What's your daily routine like?

I tend to sleep 8 or 9 hours, and don't get out of bed quickly. I will snooze my alarm and browse the internet for an
annoying amount of time before actually getting up and getting ready. I shower in the

    """
What is the meaning of life?

The meaning of life is definitely not happiness. Most simply I think meaning is found in helping others, even if that's
at the expense of yourself. An egalatarian and a philanthropic life is the highest kind of life. I don't mean philanthropy in the
billionaire public relations sense though. A small town priest who dedicates himself to the welfare of the sick and the poor and his
community is more a philanthropist than any of Gates, Buffet, and the rest put together.

    """
Where have you lived and what did you think of those places?

For 26 years I lived in Melbourne, being born in the south-east of that city. I'm obviously biased, but I think Melbourne is a first-class
place to live. I love its graffitied, coffee-soaked alleys. It has beaches and a nice summer, but also places to enjoy a cold winter by the fire.
It's multicultural, and relatively egalitarian. Inner-city Melbourne has that nice mix of social democratic spirit, live music, and craft beer.

I moved from Melbourne to Sydney, mainly to join and work for Canva. I spent about 4 years there. Sydney's beach life in amazing, if you can afford it,
and I could. Manly is idllyic, Shelly Beach in particular. But I'm not a beach and surf person. I like squirrelled away coffee shops in dark alleys. Thus,
Sydney is not exactly something I can love. Sydney's central business district is also atrocious, something I can't forgive.

For almost 6 months I've lived in New York City. NYC is everything you know it to be, an astonishing city at times. The inequality gets me down though.

    """
What do you think of ChatGPT?

I think it's incredible technology, truly mind blowing that this is real. I started paying attention to AI/ML in 2016, I was really excited about it.
Like most others, if you'd given me a 2016 chatbot and then asked me if ChatGPT would be possible by 2022 I would have said no, maybe 2030.

On the other hand, ChatGPT smears are amusing, but they are probably also yet another nail in the coffin of the literary society. 
Nowadays we are not careful readers; we skim, skip, and seek tools to sum up whole books. 
Human knowledge is in the ability to produce the particular and the ability to recognize it. 
For philosophers such as Iris Murdoch, careful attention to the particular, to just the right adjective in describing a friend, is a moral attention.

ChatGPT encourages us to seek intellectual shortcuts, and I don't like.
